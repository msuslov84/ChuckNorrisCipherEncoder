## ChuckNorrisCipherEncoder
### About:
Everything can be encrypted as different characters. And what about encryption that uses only one character 
and space? This method has a name â€” the Chuck Norris cipher. In this project, I've created a program that 
can encrypt any text into a sequence of zeros and spaces and decrypt this sequence into text.
### Description:
In this small project from JetBrains Academy I've dealt with the binary notation and data type conversion 
and work with loops and conditional statements. I've created an application for the unary representation 
and decoding of any text. Also I've used JUnit library for checking and controlling correct perfomance.
### Launch example:
* java -jar ChuckNorrisCipherEncoder.jar
### Technical information:
* Java 11 (JetBrains Runtime version 11.0.15)
* JUnit 4.13.2
